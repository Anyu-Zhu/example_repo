I'm an R Markdown document! 

# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.

# Section 3

new code chunk: option + command + i
```{r, collapse=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(1)
plot_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(1000, sd = 0.5),
  y = 1 + 2 * x + rnorm(1000),
  y_quad = 1 + 2 * x^2 + rnorm(1000)
)
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x)) + geom_histogram(col = 'red')
```

```{r assessment 1}
df = tibble(
  sample_1 = rnorm(500, mean = 1),
  filter_1 = sample_1 > 0,
  filter_2 = abs(sample_1)
)
ggplot(df, aes(x = filter_2)) + geom_histogram(col = 'red')
median_sample_1 = median(pull(df,sample_1)) # pull(data frame, column)
```
The median is `r median(median_sample_1)`
